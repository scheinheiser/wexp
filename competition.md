There's currently a decent amount of existing CYOA software, with a variety of online and free tools.

## Twine
The most popular/mentioned platform is Twine, which runs on both the browser and desktop.\
It provides users a GUI where they can make and edit nodes, allowing them to slowly build up a story.\
\
Each node can be labelled, and text can be written inside; alongside some text alignment/size/colour manipulation settings, they also offer a macro-based system. It acts similar to a limited scripting language, where you can accept user input, use mutable variables, and have access to very basic control flow[^1].\
They also allow you to embed HTML into the passage.\
\
Twine also offers a builtin story tester and debugger, which allows you to keep track of all of your variables, deactivate certain macros, and more.

[^1]: It only consists of `if` statements, and you can only obscure/show text with the effect; they do provide a variety of coniditons though.
