# Hosting Options
There are two main hosting options for this product on a smartphone; either as a website, or as a native app.\
The product could also be built to work on a feature phone, similar to the recent rise of [dumb phones](https://www.vice.com/en/article/best-dumb-phones/), or it could be modelled around using a specific feature on smartphones (like [USSD codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_Supplementary_Service_Data)).

## Native Application
The benefits of this option are clear, with some less obvious benefits:
+ It's easier for users to find your product, as it'll be displayed in the App Store for that device.
+ It'd be more convenient for users to just open an app from their home screen, rather than have to use their search engine to access the product.
+ You might have access to more information about the device than if you worked with a web app (i.e. you'd be able to request information about the RAM to see if you'd need to adjust graphics, etc)
+ The product would generally perform better than a web app, as the software can be optimised to work with the device hardware - web apps can't do this, leading to their reduced performance.
+ Users would be able to better integrate the app with their daily life, through functions offered by the devices' OS; for example, you can create Shortcuts on IOS devices to perform certain actions like opening the app or making a GIF.
+ Native apps can be used offline, giving the user more flexibility in how they use it.

There are some downsides to this choice of host, however:
- You have to abide by the vendor's app guidelines, and it the time it takes for the app to be reviewed is quite unpredictable (possibly affecting deadlines).
- Unless you want to limit yourself to just one phone OS, you'd need to either familiarise yourself with mulitple different programming languages to be able to increase your userbase or hire developers that are familiar with those languages. This would be very costly and time consuming, and it'd be combined with the need to also maintain the application on each platform.
- You may need to entirely redesign parts of the application if it relies heavily on APIs that just aren't present/available in the other OS, increasing development time and cost.
- Most platforms require you to pay a fee before you're able to publish the app onto its store; some are more costly than others (e.g. Apple requires you to pay $99 yearly to publish apps).

Overall, I think that this is a solid option that works best if you target a single platform; you get all of the benefits of increased performance, offline usage and a look tailored to the operating system while removing the costly development.\
While this would mean that you lose out on the larger customer base initially, if the product is successful it wouldn't be too difficult to expand the development team to also work on the app for another OS. If the product isn't as successful as hoped, then it would mean that you didn't sink too much money into the app development anyways, reducing the impact of the failure.
