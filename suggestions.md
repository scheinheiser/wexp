# Design Suggestions
I will give some suggestions for the design of the CYOA product, splitting it into focus on the maker and focus on the (CYOA) player.

## CYOA Maker
Like I mentioned in the competition page, I believe that it'd be best to either go with an extensive scripting language or a GUI[^1] to make CYOAs; you could use a mix of both approaches[^2], or offer both options to the user and auto-generate code in the language based on the choices made in the GUI.\
I would, out of the options, go with both a scripting language and GUI (which would be simpler/less extensive than the language) and translate stories made in the GUI to the language; this would make it approachable for beginners as they'd be able to experiment with making stories in the GUI and then be able to study the output, learning the language as they get more experienced. More advanced users would be able to take advantage of the increased customisation afforded by working with the language itself, allowing them to create more complex and in-depth adventures.\
This would reduce the load on the development team, as they wouldn't need to make the GUI able to do everything that the language would be able to do; ultimately, creating a language would require less effort compared to making a fast and responsive GUI. Having a less complex GUI would also mean that the team could focus on giving the language enough features to where it could better compete with existing software like Ink and Inform 7, giving the product a better chance at being successful in the current market.

### Language Design
Considering the design of the language itself, I think it should avoid syntax commonly seen in popular programming languages - it's not a guarantee that everyone who uses the software also is familiar with modern programming languages and their syntax, so it could be hard to attract new users if the language looks too difficult to get into.\
A syntax inspired by Ink and Ren'Py would be best, in my opinion - they both make a good compromise between ease-of-parsing and naturality (i.e. it feels like/similar to prose), while keeping the syntax of the language lightweight. This, once again, makes it easy to approach for new users - it also makes it easier to parse and translate the source code to data structures in the programming language that it has been implemented in, making the codebase easier to approach and debug.

I would heavily recommend focusing on a native app for these aspects of the product; you could make a GUI for mobile apps, and focus on both a code editor and GUI for desktop but I think that making a website wouldn't be as worthwhile. The reduced performance and screen space (due to the browser's UI) would intefere with the user experience, and make it frustrating to develop in it; like I said in the hosting page, it would be better suited as a subset of the actual application to funnel users to the native app. This would reduce the issues with performance, and reduce the need to work with a language like JavaScript/TypeScript[^3].

[^1]: When I say GUI, I'm referring to a very visual and interactive UI, such as chunks of text that you'd be able to move around and rearrange, links that you'd be able to draw between 2 nodes to set the flow of the story, etc. Similar to Twine's story editor, or how you can interact with blocks of code in [BBC's makecode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#editor).
[^2]: Like Twine, you could have a basic language that can be used within the GUI; it could also be that you make the GUI to be a way to visually interact with the structure of the story, as studying code to find any possible bugs/logical errors (e.g. you've connected a choice to the wrong consequence) can be difficult. That functionality could be contained within a feature like Inky's 'play pane', but as stories become more complex and long, it would take too much effort to play through the whole story just to test/debug one small part of it.

## CYOA Player
Whether its a native app or website, I think that it would be good to also advertise CYOAs made with the tool - not only would this inspire other users to try the tool if they see a particularly complex or interesting story built with it, but it would also increase engagement with the site/app (as they'd be more likely to play more adventures after their first) which would increase how much the app is pushed by the algorithm on the platform.\
This could be extended with something like a community highlights section, where adventures that have been made within a certain timeframe (e.g. the week) are rated on certain categories - a forum would pair well with this, to allow the users to communicate. This would further boost engagement and encourage the users to make more stories; obivously, these features would be better to slowly add over a period of time rather than with the launch. They'd take a lot a time, and increase the parts of the codebase that need to be maintained - if it turns out that the product isn't very successful, then at least you wouldn't have needed to subsidise the maintenance of an unused system.

Regarding playing the stories themselves, it would be a great addition to put a 'Story Completion' metric that would track how much of the story that the player had experienced - through showing the user how much they'd missed, it would encourage them to carry out repeat playthroughs rather than relying on the user's curiosity about the alternate endings/routes. It might also be good to include a summary of the user's choices/events that occurred during their playthrough - this would give the user a fun retrospective on the run and, once again, increase the user's chance of replaying the story as they can see what choices they did/didn't make.
