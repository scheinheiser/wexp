# Design Suggestions
I'll give some design suggestions for the CYOA app.

## CYOA Maker
Like I mentioned in the competition page, I believe that it'd be best to either go with an extensive scripting language or a GUI to make CYOAs; you could use a mix of both approaches[^1], or offer both options to the user and auto-generate code in the language based on the choices made in the GUI.\
I would, out of the options, go with both a scripting language and GUI (which would be simpler/less extensive than the language) and translate stories made in the GUI to the language; this would make it approachable for beginners as they'd be able to experiment with making stories in the GUI and then be able to study the output, learning the language as they get more experienced. More advanced users would be able to take advantage of the increased customisation afforded by working with the language itself, allowing them to create more complex and in-depth adventures.\
This would reduce the load on the development team, as they wouldn't need to make the GUI able to do everything that the language would be able to do; ultimately, creating a language would require less effort compared to making a fast and responsive GUI. Having a less complex GUI would also mean that the team could focus on giving the language enough features to where it could better compete with existing software like Ink and Inform 7, giving the product a better chance at being successful in the current market.

### Language Design
Considering the design of the language itself, I think it should avoid syntax commonly seen in popular programming languages - it's not a guarantee that everyone who uses the software also is familiar with modern programming languages and their syntax, so it could be hard to attract new users if the language looks too difficult to get into.\
A syntax inspired by Ink and Ren'Py would be best, in my opinion - they both make a good compromise between ease-of-parsing and naturality (i.e. it feels like/similar to prose), while keeping the syntax of the language lightweight. This, once again, makes it easy to approach for new users - it also makes it easier to parse and translate the source code to data structures in the programming language that it has been implemented in, making the codebase easier to approach and debug.

[^1]: Like Twine, you could have a basic language that can be used within the GUI; it could also be that you make the GUI to be a way to visually interact with the structure of the story, as studying code to find any possible bugs/logical errors (e.g. you've connected a choice to the wrong consequence) can be difficult. That functionality could be contained within a feature like Inky's 'play pane', but as stories become more complex and long, it would take too much effort to play through the whole story just to test/debug one small part of it.
